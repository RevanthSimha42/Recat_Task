# Job Portal Project - MERN Stack

Welcome to the Job Portal application! This platform serves as a space for job seekers to explore opportunities and apply for positions while providing employers a way to post and manage job listings. This project is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and represents a significant milestone as the developerâ€™s first large-scale project. The file structure is a work in progress and may evolve over time.

## Project Highlights
## Key Features:

- **Job Search and Application:** Users can browse, search, and apply for available jobs.
- **User Accounts:** Job seekers can register and manage their profiles, while employers can post and manage job openings.
- **Application Management:** Employers and users have tools to track job applications efficiently.

## Tech Stack:

- **React:** Frontend library for dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for scalable network applications.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework for managing API routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB** NoSQL database for storing user and job data.

## Additional Libraries:
- **bcryptjs:** Secure password hashing.
- **Formik & Yup:** User-friendly form management and validation in React.
